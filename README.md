# Ask My Docs — Multi-Tenant RAG for Legal Documents

A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for question-answering and cross-document comparison over legal PDFs (contracts, agreements, licenses). Each user gets an isolated, authenticated workspace — upload your own documents, ask questions grounded strictly in their content, or compare multiple contracts side by side, with every answer checked for faithfulness before it reaches the user.

Built as an end-to-end system: FastAPI backend, Qdrant hybrid search + Cohere reranking, Postgres-backed auth, a React chat UI, Docker orchestration, and an offline Ragas evaluation harness — not just a notebook demo.

## Key Features

**Retrieval & Generation**
- **Hybrid search** — Qdrant dense vector search fused with BM25 (Reciprocal Rank Fusion), reranked by Cohere `rerank-english-v3.0`.
- **Parent-child chunking** — small 350-char children carry precise embeddings for retrieval; 2000-char parent sections are swapped back in at answer time so the LLM sees full legal-clause context, not fragments.
- **Intent-aware routing** — questions are classified `FACT` vs `ANALYTICAL` (keyword-based, no extra LLM call) and routed to different retrieval widths (`k=3` vs `k=5`) and system prompts.
- **Conversational rephrasing** — follow-up questions with pronouns ("what about *that* clause?") are rewritten into standalone queries using conversation history before retrieval, only when needed.
- **Two-call claim-level faithfulness verification** — after every answer, a separate LLM pass extracts each factual claim (without seeing the context, to avoid bias) and checks it against the retrieved chunks for a verbatim supporting quote, producing a `PASS` / `PARTIAL` / `FAIL` verdict and a 0–1 faithfulness score per answer.
- **Streaming answers** — token-by-token via Server-Sent Events (SSE), with sources and verification results streamed alongside.
- **Multi-document comparison mode** — ask one question across 2+ documents; the model is instructed to evaluate each document independently and cite file + page for every claim, never mixing facts across documents.
- **Guardrails** — if no relevant context is retrieved, a canned refusal is streamed with zero LLM calls; refusal-paraphrase detection prevents a "confident-sounding non-answer" from being mis-verified as faithful.

**Multi-Tenancy & Auth**
- JWT-cookie authentication (httponly, 8h expiry) backed by Postgres, with password reset and per-account login lockout after repeated failures.
- Every document and every Qdrant vector is scoped to `user_id` — no cross-user data access anywhere in ask/compare/delete.
- Admin panel: user activation/deactivation, audit log viewer, cross-tenant document inventory.
- Full audit trail (`audit_logs` table) for register/login/logout/upload/ask/compare/delete/admin actions.
- Rate limiting (per-IP) and per-account lockout as independent defenses against brute force.

**Engineering**
- Dockerized end-to-end (backend, frontend, Qdrant, Postgres) via a single `docker compose up`.
- Offline evaluation harness (Ragas, judged locally via Ollama) that exercises the *real* production pipeline against a golden question set derived from the CUAD legal-contracts dataset.

**Request flow for `/ask/`:**

1. Classify intent (`FACT` / `ANALYTICAL`) → picks retrieval width + system prompt.
2. If the question references prior turns ("it", "that", …), rephrase into a standalone query using conversation history.
3. Hybrid retrieve (vector + BM25 → RRF) scoped to `user_id`, rerank with Cohere, swap children for parent context.
4. If nothing relevant was retrieved → stream a canned refusal, skip the LLM entirely.
5. Stream the answer token-by-token from Groq.
6. Attribute the answer back to source parents by embedding similarity (cosine ≥ 0.3).
7. Run the two-call claim-level faithfulness audit and stream the verdict + sources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (for the frontend)
- Docker (for Qdrant/Postgres, or the whole stack)
- API keys: [Groq](https://console.groq.com/), [Cohere](https://dashboard.cohere.com/)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=...
COHERE_API_KEY=...
RAG_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE=system_prompt_v3.txt   # optional, defaults to v3

# Auth
ENVIRONMENT=development                        # "production" enforces JWT_SECRET_KEY + secure cookies
JWT_SECRET_KEY=...                             # required in production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/askmydocs
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000                  # backend origin (also baked into the frontend build as VITE_API_URL)
APP_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173         # used to build password-reset redirect links
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333

# Optional — LangSmith tracing (off if unset)
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=...
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=ask-my-docs-rag

# Optional — Email (omit to print password-reset links to console instead)
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@askmydocs.local
```

### Run with Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Backend → `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend → `http://localhost:5173`
- Qdrant → `http://localhost:6333`
- Postgres → `localhost:5433`

> The frontend image bakes `VITE_API_URL` in at **build time** — rebuild the frontend image if the backend URL changes.

### Run Locally (without Docker)

**1. Start Qdrant and Postgres:**
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
docker run -d --name askmydocs-postgres -p 5433:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=askmydocs postgres:16-alpine
```

**2. Backend:**
```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# API at http://localhost:8000
```

**3. Frontend:**
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# UI at http://localhost:5173
```

**Optional — bulk-index a folder of PDFs** (bypasses auth/user-scoping, wipes the collection — for offline corpus loading, not per-user uploads):
```bash
python app/batch_index.py
```

---

## Using the App

1. Register an account with just an email and password (the first-ever user becomes admin).
2. Upload one or more PDFs — indexing happens immediately on file select.
3. **Ask** questions grounded in your uploaded documents; answers stream in with cited sources and a faithfulness verdict.
4. Select 2+ documents and switch to **Compare** mode to get a structured, per-document analysis of the same question.
5. Admins can access `/admin` to manage users and view audit logs.

## Evaluation Results

The eval harness runs the **actual production pipeline** (same retriever/generator code as the live API) against a golden question set derived from [CUAD](https://www.atticusprojectai.org/cuad) (real-world commercial legal contracts), scored offline via Ragas with a local Ollama judge (`llama3.1:8b`) — no eval traffic hits Groq/Cohere for scoring.

**Overall (66 questions, `ragas_eval_results_scoped.csv`):**

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Faithfulness | 0.71 |
| Answer Relevancy | 0.82 |
| Context Precision | 0.85 |

**By question type:**

| Intent | n | Faithfulness | Answer Relevancy | Context Precision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Factual | 42 | 0.62 | 0.82 | 0.81 |
| Analytical | 18 | 0.85 | 0.80 | 0.96 |
| Out-of-scope (guardrail) | 6 | 1.00 | — | — |

**Notes:**
- All 6 out-of-scope questions correctly triggered the refusal guardrail (faithfulness 1.0 by policy — a refusal cannot be unfaithful).
- Analytical questions score *higher* on faithfulness than factual ones here — counter-intuitive at first glance, but consistent with wider retrieval (`k=5` vs `k=3`) giving the analytical prompt more supporting context per claim.
- Factual faithfulness (0.62) is pulled down by strict claim-level entailment scoring from a local 8B judge model — row-level inspection found several low-scoring answers that were in fact near-verbatim-correct; this reflects judge harshness on claim decomposition as much as retrieval quality.
- A previous pipeline iteration (`ragas_eval_results_v3.csv`, fact-only golden set, no intent routing) scored ~0.86 faithfulness — **not directly comparable**, since the current golden set intentionally adds harder analytical/advisory questions and a stricter two-call verification method.

Reproduce locally:
```bash
cd Evaluation
python evaluate_rag_offline.py   # resumable — skips source_rows already in the output CSV
```

## Security Highlights

- Per-user data isolation enforced at the Qdrant filter level on every retrieval, index, and delete — no cross-tenant access path exists.
- httponly JWT cookies (no token-in-header/localStorage flow), CSP + security headers on every response, HSTS in production.
- Per-IP rate limiting (`slowapi`) **and** independent per-account login lockout after repeated failures.
- Uploaded/deleted filenames are sanitized to a bare basename before touching the filesystem — no path traversal.
- Request bodies are size-capped (question/history length, filter list sizes) to bound LLM cost and context abuse.
- Unexpected server errors are logged internally and never leak raw exception details to the client.
- Full audit log of every meaningful account and data action.

---

## Design Decisions

- **Two-tier parent-child chunking** — retrieval precision needs small chunks; legal answers need full clause context. Splitting the two lets both be true at once.
- **Two-call, claim-level faithfulness verification** — a single "is this faithful, yes/no" LLM call is too coarse and self-serving; extracting claims *before* showing context (to avoid bias) and checking each one individually against retrieved text gives a much more granular, auditable faithfulness score.
- **Intent-based routing over one-size-fits-all retrieval** — analytical/advisory questions need more supporting context than narrow factual lookups; a keyword classifier (not an extra LLM call) makes this routing free.
- **Incremental per-user indexing vs. full bulk reindex** — the live upload path only touches the affected user's `(user_id, source_file)` pair; the standalone `batch_index.py` script is intentionally separate and destructive, reserved for offline corpus loading.
